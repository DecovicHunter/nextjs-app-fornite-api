Next JS-App consuming Fornite API

- <P>Nextjs was sending about 60 requests to build the files for the dynamic route, and the api wasn't responding 
- to that much requests, leading a build fail, so beacuse of that I created a local file and stored the api data, and that were the data is coming from.
